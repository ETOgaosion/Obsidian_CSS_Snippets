# Obsidian CSS Snippets

This repository stores the css I used for customizing Obsidian.

Obsidian is Fantastic, this repo is just a reference, fork and practice your own taste!

## current contents

- `bg.css`: add background covering every corner of Obsidian app.
- `tab.css`: fix bug of tab bar width in current version of Obsidian.
- `workspace.css`: extends the width of writing space.

## usage

`cd` into `${vault}/.obsidian/` folder, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ETOgaosion/Obsidian_CSS_Snippets.git snippets
```

Make sure all `*.css` are in `vault/.obsidian/snippets/`, open the vault and go to appearence preference, in `Appearence/CSS Snippets` turn on all snippets, you will be comfortable~

All items tested on Obsidian 1.5.0, with both Mac and Windows.
