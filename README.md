# Obsidian CSS Snippets

This repository stores the css I used for customizing Obsidian.

Obsidian is Fantastic, this repo is just a reference, fork and practice your own taste!

## current contents

- `bg_dark.css`: add background covering every corner of Obsidian app for dark color scheme, as well as adjust components' colors to be more readable. Work with themes:
    - Default
    - Obsidianite
    - Obsidianotion
    - NotSwift

- `bg_light.css`: same as `bg_dark.css`, but only work for light color scheme. Work with themes:
    - Default
    - Obsidianite
    - Obsidianotion
    - NotSwift
- `blur.css`: add blur effects to tab bars and code block. Work with all themes.
- `color.css`: Use highlight color for most texts, since some themes cannot display words in sidebar clearly.
    - support both dark and light color scheme

- `font.css`: use my favorite fonts for all themes' components.
- `tab.css`: fix bug of tab bar width in current version of Obsidian.
- `workspace.css`: extends the width of writing space. Work with all themes.

## usage

`cd` into `${vault}/.obsidian/` folder, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ETOgaosion/Obsidian_CSS_Snippets.git snippets
```

Make sure all `*.css` are in `${vault}/.obsidian/snippets/`, open the vault and go to appearence preference, in `Appearence/CSS Snippets` turn on all snippets, you will be comfortable~

All items tested on Obsidian 1.5.0, with both Mac and Windows.

You can use `color.css`, `font.css`, `workspace.css` for all time. Background series depend on color scheme you use.
